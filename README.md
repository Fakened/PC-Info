This is a Python application that uses PyQt6 and Psutil libraries to monitor system status such as CPU, RAM, battery, storage, and sensors. The app can also manage system processes by running, terminating, suspending, killing, and resuming them. In addition, the app can monitor network activities such as I/O, connections, addresses, and statistics.
